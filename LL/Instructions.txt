Welcome to the living labyrinth! 
On your wild adventures to recover a hidden treasure, you found yourself lost among 
the corridors that surround you.But you found out something far scarier 
- the labyrinth is alive!
But after snooping around, you quickly notice that the labyrinth is being 
controlled by a drone. Although escaping with your life would be nice, 
you want REVENGE! Find the drone, and destroy it. 
But beware, the drone will try to evade you and landscape around you 
can suddenly shift at a moments notice!
And don't forget, you aren't the first to fall into the drone's trap, 
the drone has learned how to effectively trap you from the many other
adventurers who suffered a fate which you would like to avoid. 

Use WASD to move. You can move up to twice per turn. 

You can hear the drone and pinpoint its exact location 
at all times, but you can only see the spaces around you. 

The drone can move once per turn, and place up to two walls, 
blocking movement for both you and itself. 

You will have 1000 points at the start of each level, with each move costing 50 points. 
Your final score will be taken as the sum of your points in each level. 

The drone can see you on certain spaces depending on the difficulty of the level. 

Eventually it will be able to see the entire maze.
